            <h2>What is Air Pollution?</h2>
            <p>Air pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the air we breathe. These pollutants can be natural or man-made, and they can harm both the environment and human health. Air pollution is a major concern worldwide as it affects air quality, climate, and public health.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Types of Air Pollution</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Particulate Matter (PM)</strong>: Tiny particles suspended in the air, including dust, dirt, soot, and smoke. PM can be hazardous when inhaled deeply into the lungs.</li>
                <li><strong>Ground-Level Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)</strong>: Created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in sunlight. This "bad" ozone is different from the protective layer in the upper atmosphere.</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon Monoxide (CO)</strong>: A colorless, odorless gas produced by burning fossil fuels. High levels of CO can be harmful to human health.</li>
                <li><strong>Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)</strong>: Produced by burning fossil fuels and industrial processes. It can cause respiratory problems and acid rain.</li>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)</strong>: Emitted from vehicles and industrial processes, contributing to smog and acid rain.</li>
                <li><strong>Lead</strong>: Previously found in gasoline and paints, lead is now mainly from industrial processes. It is toxic, particularly to children.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="description">Mobile, stationary, area, and natural sources all emit pollution into the air.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vehicles</strong>: Emissions from cars, trucks, and buses contribute significantly to urban air pollution.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial Processes</strong>: Factories, power plants, and other industrial facilities release pollutants into the air.</li>
                <li><strong>Agricultural Activities</strong>: Use of pesticides, fertilizers, and livestock emissions contribute to pollution.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Sources</strong>: Wildfires, volcanoes, and dust storms release pollutants naturally.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Impact of Air Pollution</h2>
            <p>Air pollution affects the environment and human health in several ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Health Issues</strong>: Respiratory diseases (e.g., asthma, bronchitis), cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer can result from long-term exposure to polluted air.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Damage</strong>: Acid rain harms plants, soil, and water sources. Pollution also affects wildlife by damaging habitats and food sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Change</strong>: Pollutants like CO<sub>2</sub> and methane contribute to global warming, affecting weather patterns, sea levels, and ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Ways to Mitigate Air Pollution</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Switch to Renewable Energy</strong>: Using solar, wind, and hydro power reduces reliance on fossil fuels.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Public Transportation</strong>: Reducing the number of cars on the road decreases emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Implementing Air Quality Regulations</strong>: Government regulations can limit emissions from industries and vehicles.</li>
                <li><strong>Encouraging Green Practices</strong>: Using energy-efficient appliances, recycling, and minimizing waste all contribute to cleaner air.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting Trees</strong>: Trees absorb CO<sub>2</sub> and other pollutants, improving air quality.</li>
            </ul>
